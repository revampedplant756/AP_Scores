# AP_Scores
This is the code that I used to both clean and prep the data, which is located in AP_scores_research file, and then test on the models, which is located in the ML_Code file. Also on the ML_Code file is the SHAP analysis. All of the code was done in Python.

This is the abstract of the final paper.
